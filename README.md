This web program is a closet storage. Telling the user what is in there closet, what colour it is, and what category(hat, shirt, pants etc) it falls under.
The only think broken is the dropmenu data does not seem to carry over the data and save it to the database. Unlike both Colour and name which seem to carry no problem.
2 Databases were used, Closet to store the data and Clothes to store the dropdown menu.

The user can add and view the contents of the database.
